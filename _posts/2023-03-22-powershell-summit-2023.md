## I'm ready for PowerShell Summit 2023!

I've been part of the PowerShell community for a few years now and I've attended some amazing sessions with user groups.
I've also presented a few times, once for a PowerShell Saturday and a couple other times remotely.
For Summit '21, I had a presentation via video on demand and a lightning demo.

Over the last few years, I've been ask how many times have I attended PowerShell Summit.
Fully gripped with a backlog of FOMO, I'd give a sigh and say, "I've never been in person."

I'm excited to say that will be changing this year!

Flight, check.
Hotel, check.
AirBnb and car rental for a trip down to Vancouver and Portland, check.

> I'm attending my first PowerShell & DevOps Global Summit this year and I'm also a presenter!

If you're interested in attending, please check out [PowerShellSummit.org][PowerShellSummit]{:target="_blank"} where you can [register][Register]{:target="_blank"}. But hurry, registration closes on April 7th!

## Talks

In hopes of being selected to present, I submitted three session ideas.
I was pleasantly surprised when I was notified that two of them were selected.

### Your Code is Flawless, But How YOU Doing?

If you find yourself without a session to attend Wednesday afternoon, [Andrew Pla][AndrewPla]{:target="_blank"} (the [PowerShell Podcast][PowerShellPodcast]{:target="_blank"} master shiller) and
I invite you to our session where we will share our individual paths of self discovery and
healing leading to healthier mental states and happier lives.

### BluebirdPS: From Nesting to Hatched and Flying

The next day, I will be talking about [BluebirdPS][BluebirdPS]{:target="_blank"}, a PowerShell 7 Twitter automation client I wrote a couple years back.
While I've presented about BluebirdPS previously, this talk will be more about the creation and
care-and-feeding of a publicly consumed module.

### DevOps Fundamentals (OnRamp)

I've presented on my own [DevOps journey][DevOpsJourney]{:target="_blank"} at the 2019 PowerShell Saturday for [RTPSUG][RTPSUG]{:target="_blank"}.
At that time, I was still working as a systems engineer even though I had been learning *the ways of DevOps*.
At the end of August 2020, I started my first position as a DevOps engineer delving deep into AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and Python.

Last December, after the Summit speakers had been selected and notified, I received an email from [Jeff Hicks][JeffHicks]{:target="_blank"} asking me to present on DevOps fundamentals and concepts.
Of course, I accepted the offer.
*Who would turn down a opportunity to give back to the community?*

I'm eager to share with the OnRamp attendees the paradigm shift that goes along with adopting DevOps methodologies.

## A Very Welcoming Community

The people that comprise the PowerShell community, like you reader, sets this community apart from many others.
Here you will find genuine encouragement and freely shared tips, tricks, and lessons on PowerShell
and other facets of the modern IT world.

You have welcomed me.
And I'm thankful and grateful to you and all of the connections that I've made over the years.

We support this community by sharing our own experiences, whether in writing blogs like this one or
presenting to a crowded room of attentive listeners.

We support this community because it supports us.

## Summary

Hopefully I'll see you at Summit next month.
If not, then perhaps next year or another [community event][CommunityEvent]{:target="_blank"},
like remote or hybrid meetings.

Thank you for being part of the community.
And thank you for reading this article.
