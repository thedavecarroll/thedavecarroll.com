  title: 'BluebirdPS: A Twitter Automation Client for PowerShell 7'
  event: Southern California PowerShell User Group - December Remote Meeting
  abstract: |
    In this discussion, we will take a look at BluebirdPS, a new PowerShell module for Twitter.
    We will examine some of the functions, including live tweeting, and then dive into use cases
    and an overview of the module design.
    If time permits, we will deep dive into the helper (private) functions that interact
    with the Twitter API directly and provide output including tailored errors.

  title: 'Automating Twitter: Using PowerShell to Call the Twitter API'
  event: Research Triangle PowerShell User Group - October Presentation
  abstract: |
    Dave Carroll is a DevOps engineer who blogs regularly about how to use PowerShell to get your job done easier.
    Over the last 20+ years, he has focused on automation with half of that time spent honing his PowerShell skills,
    from the first command to his open source modules.
    Dave has created a Twitter module for PowerShell that allows him to automate his tweets from his cmd prompt.
    Join Dave for a look at how he figured out how to use the Twitter API, handle the authentication requirements
    and deal with errors while tweeting. We'll wrap this all up with some live tweeting!

  title: Crossing the Divide - A System Administrator's Path to DevOps
  event: Research Triangle PowerShell User Group - PowerShell Saturday
  abstract: |
    Sysadmins and programmers have been divided for years, not just in job duties, but also organizationally, culturally,
    and philosophically. We will examine one systems administrator's journey to see how they acquired some of the
    prerequisite skill sets and changed their mindset on the path to DevOps.
